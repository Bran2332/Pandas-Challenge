  # Smaller schools with less than 1000 students and medium schools that range from 1000-2000 students perform the best and drastically better compared to larger schools.  They present a very similar overall passing % being 89.8% and 90.62% compared to larger schools which have a poor 58% overall passing %.

# It's also very clear that Charter schools have a very high overall passing % compared to District schools.  Charter Schools have a very high 90.4 overall passing percentage compared to a poor 53.7 overall passing percentage from District schools.

# Finally having a higher spending per student does not guarantee success, the data actually shows that the higher the spending per student the less overall passing percetange.  This could be an indication that smaller schools that have teachers and staff that can dedicate more time and attention to their students will produce better results in terms of overall passing percetange.
